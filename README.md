Lab 2


Problem
Every country has a change in population over time (up or down) due to three causes: births, deaths, and migration. Write a program that estimates future population size for a country given its number of births, deaths, and migrations per second, the current population, and the desired number of years in the future for the estimate. For example, if the user enters 0.125 births per second, 0.0833 deaths per second, 0.0357 inmigrations per second, a current population of 326,766,748 (estimates from the US Census) and wants to estimate the population 5 years into the future, the program should respond with an estimate of 338,971,180. Note: to specify net emmigration, use a negative number for migration.

Instructions
Create test cases (see section below).
Create a new Python file and include intro comments at the top of your .py file (template below).
Use comments to write the algorithm your program will follow.
Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
Test your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
Commit and push changes and check github.com to confirm the update before leaving lab (even if not finished).

Test Cases
Create an Excel File with at least five test cases. Use one row per test case with a column for test number, a column for each input, followed by a column for each corresponding output. Use a calculator if needed to compute the outputs. Use the example in the problem statement as your first test case.
